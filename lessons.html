			These are my Sunday school lessons. You can read them here, print them, or download them as PDF's if you wish. The download will include the teacher's lesson & the student handouts. These are free to anyone. Download them to keep up with your kids in class or use them for your own group's study.

			My lessons are typically based strait from scripture & are my interpretations of the scriptures. I dislike using a Sunday School book since they typically avoid things so as to not hurt feelings, and like to use one verse to try & support a whole argument. I like to use a whole chapter or block of scripture instead of a couple of verses. I believe itâ€™s good for the kids to read The Word for them selves & to find and pull out the points on their own. I like for them to see where I got the idea from, not just hear it.

			The lessons contained here are most likely what was taught that day, almost word for word. However, some days since we discuss lessons in my class the topics might have shifted. I do try my best to keep the lessons on topic & on track.
