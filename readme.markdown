=======
This is my personal website & playground. 
Part of this site is devoted to my code sandbox where i'll be working on CSS, HTML & JavaScript.
Part of this site will be devoted to my small and humble portfolio. Rather like an online business card.
Part of this site will be for my Sunday School class & their parents. They will be able to find their lessons here. 
The last part of this site will be my blog

TO DO:
